FYI", " Encyclopedia of Quantitative Methods in R, vol. 1: Data Wrangling Sarah Schwartz &amp; Tyson Barrett Last updated: 2018-08-24 Welcome Preface This encyclopedia of eBooks is being developed by the Office of Research Services to serves the faculty and graduate students in the College of Education and Human Services at Utah State University. The three main purposes are to: Provide reference material for graduate quantitative methods courses (EDUC/PSY 6600, EDUC/PSY 7610, PSY 7650, ect.) Support college wide workshops given by the Statistical Consulting Studio and Data Science and Discover Unit Facilitate individual consultations with the authors pertaining to research. Volume Title Content Software Computer Setup Installing software (R, R Studio, and Packages), workspace oridentation, notebook workflow, and periodic updating Wrangling Data Management Importing data files (SPSS, excel, csv, ect.), sub-setting (observations and variables), creating new variables, and saving revised data Exploratory Exploratory Data Analysis Computing and tabulating summary statistics (M/SD, count/%) and creating descriptive visualizations of distributions (boxplots, histograms) and relationships (scatter plots) ANOVA Testing Mean Differences t-tests (independent groups, paired observations), ANOVA (independent or between subjects, 1-way, 2-way), RM ANOVA (repeated meausres, between subjects), mixed ANOVA (both independent and between subjects), visualizations (marginal means to prob interactions) and post hoc tests (multiple corrections, contrast statements) Regression Regression Calculating and visualizating correlation, multiple regression models (fitting, tabulating results, graphicaly probing interactions), and generalizing the distribution (GLM: logistic regression, poisson regression, ect.) Multilevel Mixed Effects Regression Modeling clustered/hierarchical or longitudinal/repeated observations with multilevel models (MLM, LMM, GLMM, HLM), including computing ICCs, model fitting, tabulating results, and visualizings (marginal means to prob interactions); generalized estimating equations (GEE) SEM Structural Equation Modeling Factor Analysis (EFA, CFA), latent variables and path analysis Other Additional Topics Room for Future Expansion The Authors Dr. Sarah Schwartz Dr. Tyson Barrett www.SarahSchwartzStats.com www.TysonBarrett.com Sarah.Schwartz@usu.edu Tyson.Battett@usu.edu Statistical Consulting Studio Data Science and Discover Unit Blocked Notes Thoughout all the eBooks in this encyclopedia, several small secitons will be blocked out in the following ways: These blocks denote an area UNDER CONSTRUCTION, so check back often. This massive undertaking started during the summer of 2018 and is far from complete. The outline of seven volumes is given above despite any one being complete. Feedback is welcome via either author’s email. These blocks denote something EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Do NOT skip these notes as they will be used very sparingly. These blocks denote something to DOWNLOAD. This may include software installations, example datasets, or notebook code files. These blocks denote something INTERESTING. These point out information we found of interest or added value. These blocks denote LINKS to other websites. This may include instructional video clips, articles, or blog posts. We are all about NOT re-creating the wheel. If somebody else has described or illustrated a topic well, we celebrate it! Code and Output This is how \\(R\\) code is shown: 1 + 1 THis is what the output of the \\(R\\) code above will look: ## [1] 2 Why choose R ? ADD SECTION: R vs. SPSS, SAS, Stata, ect… FREE, accessable, not any harder than others to learn reproducibity Check it out: an article from Fall 2016… No more excuses: R is better than SPSS for psychology undergrads, and students agree FYI This entire encyclopedia is written in \\(R Markdown\\), using \\(R Studio\\) as the text editor and the bookdown package to turn a collection of markdown documents into a coherent whole.
