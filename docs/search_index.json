Blocked Notes Thoughout all the eBooks in this encyclopedia, several small secitons will be blocked out in the following ways: These blocks denote an area UNDER CONSTRUCTION, so check back often. This massive undertaking started during the summer of 2018 and is far from complete. The outline of seven volumes is given above despite any one being complete. Feedback is welcome via either author’s email. These blocks denote something EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Do NOT skip these notes as they will be used very sparingly. These blocks denote something to DOWNLOAD. This may include software installations, example datasets, or notebook code files. These blocks denote something INTERESTING. These point out information we found of interest or added value. These blocks denote LINKS to other websites. This may include instructional video clips, articles, or blog posts. We are all about NOT re-creating the wheel. If somebody else has described or illustrated a topic well, we celebrate it! Code and Output This is how \\(R\\) code is shown: 1 + 1 This is what the output of the \\(R\\) code above will look: ## [1] 2 The Authors Dr. Sarah Schwartz Dr. Tyson Barrett www.SarahSchwartzStats.com www.TysonBarrett.com Sarah.Schwartz@usu.edu Tyson.Barrett@usu.edu Statistical Consulting Studio Data Science and Discover Unit Why choose R ? Check it out: an article from Fall 2016… No more excuses: R is better than SPSS for psychology undergrads, and students agree FYI This entire encyclopedia is written in \\(R Markdown\\), using \\(R Studio\\) as the text editor and the bookdown package to turn a collection of markdown documents into a coherent whole.
